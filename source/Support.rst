.. _label-TypesOfSupport:

Online forums (free)
----------------------------

* `Main forum <https://github.com/0todd0000/spm1d/issues/>`_ (General SPM issues)

* `Python forum <https://github.com/0todd0000/spm1d/issues/>`_ (Python-specific support)

* `MATLAB forum <https://github.com/0todd0000/spm1dmatlab/issues/>`_ (MATLAB-specific support)







Forum Guidelines
----------------------------

* **Please do**:

  * Report software bugs.
  * Explain your problem as clearly and specifically as possible.
  * Paste figures, code snippets and error messages.
  * Separate your questions into as many sub-issues as possible, and post each as a separate issue. This will make it easy to cross-reference discussions.
  

* **Please do NOT**:

  * Attach entire scripts.  (We will only check and debug code released with the **spm1d** package.)
  * Attach data files.  (We can not analyze datasets; we will instead help you debug your data issues.)




Consultancy
----------------------------

We also provide **paid** consultancy services.

If the free forums are unsuitable for your needs please contact the Consulting Team at consulting@spm1d.org for a consultation quote.
