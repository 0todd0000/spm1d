.. danger:: Unbalanced two- and three-way repeated-measures ANOVA results have not been verified.
	
	Example: more subjects in Group 1 than in Group 2.
	
	Please interpret results for these designs with caution, and recognize that they might not be valid.

.. warning:: There are a few key differences between the MATLAB and Python versions of **spm1d**. The main version of **spm1d** is the Python version, and the MATLAB version incorporates much but not all of the functionaly of the Python version. A key difference is that the MATLAB version of **spm1d** does not yet employ non-sphericity corrections, which are employed by default in the Python version. Practically these differences are likely to be small.


Examples
-----------------
Inside the **./spm1d/examples** folder you will find Matlab scripts which implement a variety of statistical tests.

These examples correspond to the Python scripts of the same name, which are described in: :ref:`the main documentation <label-Documentation>`.

Statistical theory underlying the examples is documented here: :ref:`label-Theory`


Support
-----------------
We do not provide detailed documentation for the MATLAB version of **spm1d**.

If you require support consider the following options:

#. Running the example scripts in `+spm1d/examples`.
#. Checking the :ref:`Python documentation <label-Documentation>` (the syntax is nearly identical).
#. Submitting a support request to **spm1d**'s `MATLAB github site <http://0todd0000.github.io/spm1dmatlab>`_.
#. Contacting us to request an :ref:`educational workshop <label-Workshops>`.
