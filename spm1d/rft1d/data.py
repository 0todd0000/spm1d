	This dataset was made available by Prof. James O. Ramsay
	of McGill University. The dataset was download from:
	http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/misc/fda/downloads/FDAfuns/Matlab
	on 16 August 2014 (see the `./examples/weather` directory).
	
	No license was found with that dataset. Only "daily.m" and
	"daily.mat" from that dataset are redistributed here, on
	the condition that the original source be acknowledged.

	The dataset is described here:
	http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/misc/fda/ex-weather-a1.html
	and also in:
	Ramsay JO, Silverman BW (2005). Functional Data Analysis
	(Second Edition), Springer, New York.
	Chapter 13: "Modelling functional responses with
	multivariate covariates"
	
	Data subsets include:

	- 'Atlantic'
	- 'Pacific'
	- 'Continental'
	- 'Arctic'
	
	
	:Example use:
	
	>>> weather = rft1d.data.weather()
	>>> y = weather['Atlantic']  # (15 x 365) numpy array
	>>> from matplotlib import pyplot
	>>> pyplot.plot(y.T)
