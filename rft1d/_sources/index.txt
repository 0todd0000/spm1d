One-Dimensional Random Field Theory
============================================

**rft1d** is a Python package for exploring and validating Random Field Theory (RFT)
expectations regarding upcrossings in univariate and multivariate 1D continua.
These expectations can be used to make statistical inferences regarding signals
observed in experimentally measured 1D continua including scalar and vector time series.
