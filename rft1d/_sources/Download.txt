Automated installation
----------------------------

.. note:: Automated installation assumes that Python is already installed and that the
	`setuptools <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_ and `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/>`_ are packages also also installed. To check whether you have these packages enter ``import setuptools`` and ``import pip`` into a Python script or interactive session; if no errors are generated you should be fine.


The easiest way to download and install **rft1d** is using one of the following commands::

	easy_install rft1d

or::

	pip install rft1d


These commands will find the **rft1d** source code at the
`Python Package Index <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rft1d/>`_ ,
then download it and install it to your default Python ``site-packages`` directory.
If you are not sure how to find your ``site-packages`` directory,
`check out this discussion at stackoverflow.com <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/122327/how-do-i-find-the-location-of-my-python-site-packages-directory/>`_ .
To uninstall **rft1d** simply delete the **rft1d** folders from your ``site-packages`` directory.
