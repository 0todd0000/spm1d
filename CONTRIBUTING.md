## How to contribute

#### **Software bug**

* **Check whether the bug has already been reported** by searching this repository's [issues](https://github.com/0todd0000/spm1d/issues).

* If no issue addressing the problem already exists, [open a new issue](https://github.com/0todd0000/spm1d/issues/new/). Include a **concise, clear title and a minimal, clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and preferably a [minmal reproducible example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_reproducible_example) demonstrating the problem.

* For additional details please visit our [Support page](https://spm1d.org/Support.html).

#### **Bug fix?**

* First check for existing software bug reports (see above). If none exists then...

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the bug fix. Ensure that your description clearly describes the problem and the solution. Include relevant issue number(s) if applicable.

#### **Cosmetic fix?**

Code changes that are purely cosmetic in nature (e.g. whitespace / tab changes) and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Rails should generally be avoided unless the changes substantially improve code readability.

#### **New feature?**

* Suggest your change by posting a comment in [feature requests](https://github.com/0todd0000/spm1d/issues/45)

* Do not open a new issue on GitHub until the suggested change has collected positive feedback. New GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Source code questions?**

* Feel free to ask questions about the source code in this repository's [issues](https://github.com/0todd0000/spm1d/issues). Please follow "Software bug" protocol (above) as closely as possible.

#### **General statistics questions?**

* Please avoid posting statistics / interpretation questions to this repository's [issues](https://github.com/0todd0000/spm1d/issues). Statistics questions should generally posted to other forums like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) or [Stats @ Stack Exchange](https://stats.stackexchange.com).
