Workshops
=====================================

Do you struggle to decide which variables to extract from your biomechanical data, particularly if you are recording motion data from different joints, 3D force data, or EMG data from various muscles?

Do you think that there are better ways to explore your data, but these are probably too complex to use unless if you are an engineer?

**Now think again!**

- In this workshop series you will learn to understand the concepts underpinning SPM. 
- You will conduct SPM analyses in **MATLAB** AND learn how to include SPM in your scientific reporting.
- A certificate can be earned at the end of the two-day workshop, based on successfully conducting  hypothesis tests on experimental and simulated data.
