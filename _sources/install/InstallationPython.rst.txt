Detailed installation (Python)
=====================================



Python users
________________

**spm1d** requires the following packages:

* `Python 2.7 <http://www.python.org>`_
* `NumPy 1.9 <http://numpy.org>`_
* `SciPy 0.15 <http://scipy.org>`_
* `Matplotlib 1.4 <http://matplotlib.org>`_

Newer or older versions may work but have not been tested.

Once those packages are installed, open a Terminal (Linux, Mac) or a Command Prompt (Windows) and enter:

.. code::

	easy_install spm1d

	To check installation:

	>>> import spm1d

________________

Python is a free-and-open-source object-oriented programming language.

To install Python we highly recommend `Enthought Canopy <https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/>`_.

The free (as in beer) **Canopy Express** installation contains all of the libraries you will need to get started with **spm1d**.

Enthought also offers a free (as in beer) academic license for users who may want additional functionality.

After Canopy is installed, open a Terminal (Linux, Mac) or a Command Prompt (Windows) and enter:

.. code::

	easy_install spm1d

After that command finishes running, launch an interactive Python session by entering:

.. code::

	ipython

To check installation enter the following command at the Python command prompt:

	>>> import spm1d


If there are no error messages generated then congratulations, you're ready to go!



.. .. warning:: The **spm1d** team can only offer direct support for Enthought Canopy.
..
.. 	If you have issues with other distributions (e.g. Spyder, PythonXY) we would be pleased to receive your comments at **spm1d**'s `github site <https://github.com/0todd0000/spm1d/>`_ , but we can't guarantee fixes.
