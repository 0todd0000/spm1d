Detailed installation (Python)
=====================================



Python users
________________

**spm1d** requires the following packages:

* `Python 3.8 <http://www.python.org>`_
* `NumPy 1.19 <http://numpy.org>`_
* `SciPy 1.6 <http://scipy.org>`_
* `Matplotlib 3.3 <http://matplotlib.org>`_

Newer or older versions may work but have not been thoroughly tested.

If you are new to Python we highly recommend starting out with the `Anaconda package <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual>`_ .  All of spm1d's dependencies are available in the default Anaconda installation.

After installing Anaconda, open a Terminal (Linux, Mac) or an Anaconda Command Prompt (Windows) and enter::

	pip install spm1d


To check installation, launch Python or IPython::

	ipython

then enter:

	>>> import spm1d

If there are no error messages generated then congratulations, you're ready to go!





.. New to Python?
..
.. Python is a free-and-open-source object-oriented programming language.
..
.. To install Python we highly recommend `Anaconda
 .. <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual>`_.
..
.. **Anaconda** contains all of the libraries you will need to get started with **spm1d**.
..
.. Enthought also offers a free (as in beer) academic license for users who may want additional functionality.
..
.. After Canopy is installed, open a Terminal (Linux, Mac) or a Command Prompt (Windows) and enter::
..
.. 	easy_install spm1d
..
.. After that command finishes running, launch an interactive Python session by entering::
..
.. 	ipython
..
.. To check installation enter the following command at the Python command prompt:
..
.. 	>>> import spm1d
..
..
.. If there are no error messages generated then congratulations, you're ready to go!



.. .. warning:: The **spm1d** team can only offer direct support for Enthought Canopy.
..
	.. If you have issues with other distributions (e.g. Spyder, PythonXY) we would be pleased to receive your comments at **spm1d**'s `github site <https://github.com/0todd0000/spm1d/>`_ , but we can't guarantee fixes.
